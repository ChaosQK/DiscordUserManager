# DiscordUserManager

This is a Discord User Manager which will verify users every hour. If a user has been inactive for more than 7 days it will be added a certain role and his main role removed.

You can check the inactive time of a user with the command !check @Username

Typing in a text chat, joining / leaving a voice channel, muting deafning / unmuting undeafning in a voice channel resets the time of inactivity.

My code is free of use, you may use it like it is or modify it if you want.
